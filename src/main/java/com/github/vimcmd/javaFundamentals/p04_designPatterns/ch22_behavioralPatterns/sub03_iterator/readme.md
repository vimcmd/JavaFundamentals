# Iterator

Defines the way to iterate or sequential access of the composite class instance without
revealing its structure. Determined in standard Java collections classes for separation
collection iteration algorithm from its content. Iterated class itself may not be a collection,
but usually in this case, it must aggregate object collection.

It allows user to determine method and sorting options. It may be several iteration
ways: ascending, descending, setting up an iteration step and so on.
