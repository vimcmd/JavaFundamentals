# Builder

The Builder pattern foreknows an object type, while its main objective is
to determine ways to create an object based on the passed parameters. It is
necessary to implement the initialization process complex object with a complex
construction process, defining only type and properties. Details of object construction
or its parts remain hidden and are defined in subclasses.
